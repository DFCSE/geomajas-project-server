    <title>How to avoid error messages when changing the current window
    location ?</title>

    <para>Sometimes you will want to redirect the current browser window to
    another location (different URL). This is the expected behaviour when a
    user clicks on an external link, for example. When the client is still
    waiting for outstanding command responses, this can cause warning messages
    to pop up (default Geomajas behaviour). To avoid such messages, use the
    following code:</para>

    <programlisting>WindowUtil.setLocation("&lt;put your external url here&gt;");</programlisting>
