 * Call-back holder for a command. When a response returns from the server (either successfully or with errors to
 * report), the call-backs within this object will be executed. The idea is that you send out a request with a certain
 * call-back, but perhaps while the command is being send, you may want to do some extra calculations with the results.
 * No need to send out an extra command to the server, just add a call-back here.
