  <title>Common GWT</title>

  <para>The common GWT module is a module with common code for the two GWT
  based faced, the GWT face which uses the SmartGWT widget library, and the
  pure GWT face which is not tied to a widget library.</para>

  <para>Some of the features include the command dispatcher, which includes
  some important security hooks, and a string of utility classes which can
  help you in your application.</para>

  <section id="common-dispatcher">
    <title>Command dispatcher</title>

    <para>The command dispatcher allows you to communicate to the server using
    the Geomajas command interface with the Geomajas built-in support for
    security and localization. Using the GwtCommandDispatcher class, you can
    send your request objects to the server and process the
    response.</para>

    <para>A simple invocation looks like this:</para>

    <xi:include href="listing/GwtCommandExecution.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

    <para>The security will be handled automatically by the command
    dispatcher.</para>

    <para>You can register a token request handler which is invoked when the
    command returns with an invalid token exception (or any security exception
    when the token is null). Once the new token is available, the command will
    be retried.</para>

    <para>There are events on the dispatcher for changes in token. You can
    register a handler for them.</para>

    <para>There are also events to indicate when a command is in process or
    not.</para>

    <para>The dispatcher includes methods to request details about the current
    token and the logged i user.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Getting configuration</title>

    <para>There is a special service for getting the client configuration from
    the server. This is the ClientConfigurationService class. It serves as a
    central access point for your application configuration and limits the
    number of request for configuration information to the server.</para>

    <para>It is specifically built to be extensible. You con define how the
    application configuration is obtained from the server. This allows you to
    replace the invocation of the GetConfiguration command by something which
    also contains application specific information. Have a look at the
    staticsecurity example application for an example how this can be
    used.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Utility classes</title>

    <para>Several utility classes have been provided.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Log</title>

      <para>This is a simple utility class which allows you to log
      data.</para>

      <para>You can force logging to the server log or use the usual log
      levels. The normal logging uses commons logging. You can configure in
      your .gwt.xml file how this should be treated, see <ulink
      url="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideLogging.html">http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideLogging.html</ulink>.
      The error and warn levels will also log to the server.</para>
