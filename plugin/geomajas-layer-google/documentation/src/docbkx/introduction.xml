  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The Google layer allows you to use Google maps imagery as a raster
  layer in Geomajas. There are three possible types of images which can be
  displayed: the normal view displays street data, satellite view displays
  satellite images and physical view displays a hybrid of street and elevation
  information.</para>
