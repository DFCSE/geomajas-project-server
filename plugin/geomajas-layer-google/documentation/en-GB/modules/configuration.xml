    <title>Google Maps layer configuration</title>

    <para>Make sure your class path contains the required plug-in. If you are
    using Maven, add the following dependency to your pom:</para>

    <xi:include href="../listing/GoogleLayerDependency.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

    <para>A complete Google layer configuration looks as follows:</para>

    <xi:include href="../listing/GoogleLayerSample.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

    <para>
      <table>
        <title>GoogleLayer configuration</title>

        <tgroup cols="2">
          <colspec colnum="1" colwidth="1*" />

          <colspec colnum="2" colwidth="2*" />

          <thead>
            <row>
              <entry>GoogleLayer configuration</entry>
            </row>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <row>
              <entry>satellite</entry>

              <entry>Set to true to use satellite view from Google. When false
              (the default), the normal view (showing streets) will be
              used.</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>
    </para>

    <para>The layer info inner bean has the same general content as usual.
    There are some simplifications though. There is no need to provide
    resolutions or tile size (256x256 is always used). The crs should always
    be set to Mercator ("EPSG:900913").</para>

    <para>On the layer, you can set the "satellite" property to choose between
    using normal display (showing streets) or satellite view (by setting this
    to "true").</para>

    <note>
      <para>You need to assure that you comply with Google's terms of use (see
      <ulink
      url="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/</ulink>).
      Some of the things you need to do include adding the Google API code in
      your application (using a Google API key when not running on localhost),
      and (from the GWT face, using the <code>GoogleAddon</code> class to
      assure the copyright notes are displayed on the map.</para>
