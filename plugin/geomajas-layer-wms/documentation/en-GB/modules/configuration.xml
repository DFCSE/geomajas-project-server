    <title>WMS layer configuration</title>

    <para>A complete WMS layer configuration looks as follows:</para>

    <xi:include href="../listing/WmsLayerSample.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

    <para>As you can see, the bean class refers to the actual layer type:
    <code>org.geomajas.layer.wms.WmsLayer</code>.</para>

    <para>The first property is the layer info object, which describes the
    metadata common to all raster layers. The following properties are needed
    for this object:</para>

    <para>The layer object contains some extra properties which are
    specifically tied to the WMS server:</para>
