	  <para>Make sure your include the plug-in in your project. If you are using
	  Maven, add the following dependency to your pom:</para>

	  <example>
		<title>OpenStreetMap layer dependency</title>

		<programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
	  &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas.plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
	  &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-layer-openstreetmap&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    <title>OpenStreetMap layer configuration</title>

    <para>A complete OpenStreetMap layer configuration looks as
    follows:</para>

    <xi:include href="../listing/OsmLayerSample.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

    <para>The layer info inner bean has the same general content as usual,
    with one exception : the dataSourceName property is not necessary in this
    case. As with the WMS layer, the resolutions have been carefully chosen to
    match the tile server's resolutions. The tile width and height are implied
    by the server in this case but since they are required metadata for all
    raster layers, they should be set to the server's values: 256 x
    256.</para>
