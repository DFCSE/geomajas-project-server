    <para>As part of other plug-ins, tests or code which has the back-end in
    the same VM, this can be run as in listing <xref
    linkend="UseCommandTest" />.</para>

    <xi:include href="../listing/UseCommandTest.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />

    <para>For details on calling this command from inside a face, see the
    specific face's documentation.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>GWT widget</title>

    <para>To make it easier for you, the plug-in contains a widget which can
    be included in the GWT face.</para>

    <para>This widget consists of a text box where the user can type the
    location string. On pressing <keycode>&lt;enter&gt;</keycode> or
    indicating the search icon, the GetLocationForString command is called.
    When this returns a match, the map will zoom to that area. When the search
    is ambiguous, a pop-up with the alternatives is displayed.<figure>
        <title>Search widget</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="../images/geocoderWidget.png" width="50%" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>Including the widget is easy. In the initialization code for your
    application, add in instance of the GeocoderWidget where you want to put
    it. THis requires a couple of parameters, the map the widget is connected
    with, the description and label for the widget. In listing <xref
    linkend="createGwtWidget" /> you see an excerpt where the widget in placed
    inside the map's toolbar. The widget tries to adapt itself to the
    currently active locale.</para>

    <xi:include href="../listing/createGwtWidget.xml"
                xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
