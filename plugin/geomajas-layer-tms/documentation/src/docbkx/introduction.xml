  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This plug-in contains a raster layer definition for accessing raster
  data from TMS servers as specified by OSGeo. See the <ulink
  url="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification">Specification</ulink>.
  Although not an official OGC specification, the TMS is easy to understand
  and has the advantage of being very performing. </para>

  <para>This plug-in does not support the entire TileMapService capabilities,
  it does support a single TileMap configuration, as such a TileMap represents
  a single Layer. The supported TMS version is 1.0.0.</para>
