  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This printing plugin provides a simple yet compelling example of how
  platform independent web map printing might be implemented. Our
  implementation bypasses the browsers native printing functionality by
  rendering server side to a PDF document, which is then automatically
  downloaded to the browser. The PDF document can either be saved to the file
  system or opened in a new browser window from which native PDF printing is
  possible. As different browsers are allowed to - and will - render identical
  HTML pages in a slightly different manner, an absolute format like PDF is a
  necessity for creating reproducible prints.</para>

  <para>Our implementation makes extensive use of the excellent iText library,
  which allows direct drawing operations on a graphics context. This has the
  advantage of preserving the vectorial nature of the features in a layer,
  allowing crisp vector rendering at any zoom level.</para>
