  <title>Configuration</title>

  <para>Apart from the maven dependency configuration, most of the
  configuration options of the printing plugin are currently provided by the
  end user at runtime. To provide access to the plugin's functionality from
  the GWT face, an action has been provided that pops up a printing
  preferences window.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Dependency configuration</title>

    <para>To use the printing plugin, you have to include the plug-in
    dependencies in your pom. When using this in the GWT face and you already
    have a dependency on geomajas-dep version 1.10.36 or higher, you can
    declare this as :</para>

    <example>
      <title>printing plug-in dependency for GWT face using
      geomajas-dep</title>

      <programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas.plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-plugin-printing-gwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas.plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-plugin-printing-gwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>When not using the version from geomajas-dep, you may need to
    declare versions for both the back-end part of the plug-in and the GWT
    face part.</para>
