	<p>Welcome to the Geomajas show-case page. Know that this is work in progress.</p>
	<p>The goal of this showcase is two-fold:
		<ul>
			<li>For developers, this show-case acts as a test-case where all the functionalities can be tested. Also for new developers, the source code and XML configuration files are directly available.</li>
			<li>For users, this show-case acts as a ...well show-case. It demonstrates the many functionalities the Geomajas supports.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>For showcases regarding non-GIS related widget functionality, go to the <a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/">SmartGWT showcase page</a>.</p>
